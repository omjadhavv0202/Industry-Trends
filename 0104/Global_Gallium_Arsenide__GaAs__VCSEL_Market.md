 <p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>VCSEL produced from Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) material,VCSEL stands for vertical cavity surface emitting laser. This is a semiconductor-based laser diode that emits light or optical beam vertically from its top surface. This type offers more advantages than the Edge Emitting Lasers (EEL) that emits light from the side or from the Light Emitting Diodes (LED) that produce light from the sides and top.</p>
