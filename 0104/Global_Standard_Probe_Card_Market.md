 <p><strong style="text-align:center">Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>A Standard Probe Card is a jig used for electrical testing of an LSI (large-scale integrated circuit) chip on a wafer during the wafer test process in LSI manufacturing.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>A probe card is docked to a wafer prober to serve as a connector between the LSI chip electrodes and an LSI tester as a measuring machine. The needles of the probe card contact the LSI chip electrodes to conduct electrical testing for the go/no-go test.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>The wafer test process is highly important and highly dependent on the reliability of probe cards.</p>
