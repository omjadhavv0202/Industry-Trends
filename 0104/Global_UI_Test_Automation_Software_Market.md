 <p><strong>UI Test Automation Software</strong> is a tool that automates the process of testing the user interface (UI) of applications to ensure they function as expected across different platforms and devices. These tools simulate user interactions (like clicks, inputs, and navigation) to validate that the UI elements (buttons, forms, menus, etc.) work correctly and meet design specifications. UI test automation software helps reduce manual testing efforts, improve test coverage, and speed up the release cycles by detecting bugs early. Popular examples include Selenium, Cypress, and TestComplete.</p>
