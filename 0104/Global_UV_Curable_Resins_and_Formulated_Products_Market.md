 <p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>UV Curable Resins and Formulated Products have been developed recently to reduce the use of VOC and reactive diluents. Water is used as a diluent or dispersing medium in these coatings as it can decrease air pollution and the risk of fire as well as improve occupational health and safety. It is easier to control the viscosity of water-based formulation and convenient to apply and clean. For the waterborne UV curable system, viscosity can be managed by controlling the concentration and molecular weight of oligomers. Waterborne UV curable coatings permit excellent gloss and viscosity control, and therefore, can be applied easily with minimal or no process issues VOCs/HAPs.</p>
