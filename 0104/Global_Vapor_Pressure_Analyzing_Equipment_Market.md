 <p><strong style="text-align:center">Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by the vapor in a system in equilibrium with its solid or liquid phase at a specific temperature. The vapor pressure of any material is a function of temperature. As the temperature increases, the vapor pressure increases. Water at the sea level boils at the temperature of 100 degree Celsius which means that at 100 degrees C, water has a vapor pressure of 100kPa. The vapor pressure analyzer is a device which is used to measure the pressure or eventually the measurement of fuel volatility of liquids, solids, and oils.</p>
