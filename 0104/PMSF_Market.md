 <p>Phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluorid (PMSF) is a serine protease inhibitor that is often used to prepare cell lysis solutions in the field of biochemistry. PMSF degrades rapidly in water, so absolute alcohol, isopropyl alcohol or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is generally used to prepare stock solutions. Generally, the concentration of PMSF to perform proteolysis inhibition is 0.1-1mM. Short half-life in aqueous solution (110 minutes at pH 7, 55 minutes at pH 7.5, 35 minutes at pH 8, all at 25</p>
