<h1>Global CMO Peptide Market Research Report 2025, Forecast to 2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Peptides are synthesized by coupling the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amino group of another amino acid molecule. Due to the possibility of unintended reactions, protecting groups are common necessary. Chemical peptide synthesis most commonly starts at the carboxyl end of the peptide, and thus progress toward the amino-terminus. This is the opposite direction of protein biosynthesis.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global CMO Peptide market size was estimated at USD 2686.30 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 9450.07 million by 2032, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 15.00% during the forecast period.</p>
