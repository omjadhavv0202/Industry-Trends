<h1>Global Enzymatic Depolymerization and Recycling Market Research Report 2025, Forecast to 2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>PET depolymerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a common synthetic polymer used in plastic bottles, clothing, and packaging materials. This enzyme facilitates the depolymerization process by hydrolyzing the ester bonds in PET, converting it into its constituent monomers, such as terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. PET depolymerase plays a significant role in recycling and environmental sustainability, as it enables the efficient degradation of PET plastics, reducing their impact on landfills and the environment. The development and application of PET depolymerase represent a promising advancement in addressing the global issue of plastic waste and promoting circular economy practices.</p>
