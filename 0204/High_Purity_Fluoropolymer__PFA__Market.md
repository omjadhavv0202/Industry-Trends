 <p>Perfluoroalkoxy alkanes (PFA) are fluoropolymers. They are copolymers transparent copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether. Its properties are very similar to those of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) including high resistance to chemicals, UV, and temperature; outstanding slip and release properties; and excellent electrical properties including high dielectric strength, low dissipation factor, and low dielectric constant. However, unlike PTFE (Teflion), this fluorinated polymer is fully melt-processable by conventional molding methods including extrusion, compression, blow, transfer, and injection molding. Its maximum continuous use temperature is approximately 260</p>
