 <p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Photon-counting Computed Tomography (PCCT) is an emerging technology in CT imaging, which could represent the next major technological milestone in the field. Briefly, PCCT uses energy-resolving detectors, thereby enabling scanning at multiple energies. Photon-counting CT is an emerging technology with the potential to dramatically change clinical CT. Photon-counting CT uses new energy-resolving x-ray detectors, with mechanisms that differ substantially from those of conventional energy-integrating detectors. Photon-counting CT detectors count the number of incoming photons and measure photon energy. This technique results in higher contrast-to-noise ratio, improved spatial resolution, and optimized spectral imaging. Photon-counting CT can reduce radiation exposure, reconstruct images at a higher resolution, correct beam-hardening artifacts, optimize the use of contrast agents, and create opportunities for quantitative imaging relative to current CT technology.</p>
