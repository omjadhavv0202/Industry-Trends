<h1>Ortho-Dichlorobenzene Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>
 
 </p><p>Ortho-dichlorobenzene (Abbreviated as ODCB) is a compound in which the hydrogens on the two adjacent rings of benzene are replaced by chlorine atoms after atom substitution. Its molecular formula is C6H4Cl2. The two main methods for producing o-dichlorobenzene from chlorobenzene are: one is to prepare dichlorobenzene through the catalytic chlorination of benzene, and then to separate o-dichlorobenzene; the other is Separation of mixed dichlorobenzene from the production of chlorinated benzene. Different by-products can be obtained by controlling the degree of chlorination, and dichlorobenzene can be obtained by any means. The composition ratio of the para-ortho isomers and their isomers is the same, and the para-ortho-position ratio is basically 2 ~ 3:1. Ortho-dichlorobenzene is an important raw material and intermediate application body for medicines, pesticides, and fuels.</p><p>
