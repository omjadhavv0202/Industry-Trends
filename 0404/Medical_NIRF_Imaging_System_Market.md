<h1>Medical NIRF Imaging System Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Near Infrared Fluorescence (NIRF) Imaging is a cutting-edge medical technology that uses near-infrared light (wavelengths greater than 760 nm) to excite fluorescence agents introduced into the body. These agents emit light in response to the NIR light, which is then captured to form an image. This allows healthcare providers to visualize tissues and organs in real-time during various surgical procedures. The technology has proven invaluable in improving the accuracy of surgery by enabling better identification of tissue structures, tumors, blood vessels, and other vital areas of interest. Commonly applied in cardiovascular, cancer, gastrointestinal, and plastic surgeries, NIRF imaging is revolutionizing surgical precision.</p>
