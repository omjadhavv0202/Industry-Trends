<h1>Medical Neonatal Ventilators Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Neonatal ventilators are specialized medical devices designed to provide ventilatory support to preterm and critically ill infants who suffer from respiratory failure. These infants typically have low-compliance lungs, small tidal volumes, high airway resistance, and elevated respiratory rates. Neonatal ventilators deliver precise and controlled breaths, ensuring optimal oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal while minimizing lung injury. The devices are categorized into invasive and non-invasive ventilators, each serving distinct clinical needs based on the severity of the infant???s condition.</p>
