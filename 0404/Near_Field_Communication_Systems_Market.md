<h1>Near Field Communication Systems Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range wireless communication technology that enables devices to exchange data when placed within close proximity, typically within a few centimeters. NFC operates using radio frequency identification (RFID) and interconnection technology integration, incorporating inductive card readers, point-to-point communication, and contactless payment solutions. This technology is widely used for mobile payments, electronic ticketing, access control, identity authentication, and anti-counterfeiting applications.</p>
