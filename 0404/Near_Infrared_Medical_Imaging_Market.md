<h1>Near Infrared Medical Imaging Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Near Infrared Medical Imaging is mainly Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging, an emerging clinical technology that requires administration of a fluorescence-imaging agent that can be excited at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (more than 760?nm). Upon illuminating tissue surfaces with penetrating NIR light to excite the imaging agent within the tissues, the generated fluorescence is collected to form a image demarking the tissue deposition of the NIRF imaging agent. This technology has been widely used in various surgeries nowadays, such as Cardiovascular Surgery, Cancer Surgery, Gastrointestinal Surgery and Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery etc.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global Near Infrared Medical Imaging market size was estimated at USD 508.10 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 1278.81 million by 2032, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 10.80% during the forecast period.</p>
