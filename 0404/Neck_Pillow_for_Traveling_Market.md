<h1>Necrotic Enteritis Treatment Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Necrotic Enteritis (NE) is a significant enteric disease that primarily affects poultry, causing severe damage to the intestinal epithelium. The disease leads to the formation of necrotic patches in the intestines, disrupting digestion and nutrient absorption. It primarily affects juvenile broilers, leading to increased mortality and reduced productivity in the poultry industry. The treatment market for necrotic enteritis focuses on providing solutions to control and prevent this disease, including medications, probiotics, and vaccines. These treatments are crucial for maintaining the health of poultry flocks, ensuring high yield and economic sustainability in the poultry industry.</p>
