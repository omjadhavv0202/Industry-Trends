<h1>Needle Coke for Anode Materials for Li-ion Battery Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Needle coke is used for the production of synthetic graphite and it is the only suitable material for manufacturing of the highest quality, 99% plus pure graphite through graphitisation process. The anode is the negative electrode of a primary cell and is always associated with the oxidation or the release of electrons into the external circuit. In a rechargeable cell, the anode is the negative pole during discharge and the positive pole during charge. The vast majority of lithium-ion batteries use graphite powder as an anode material. Graphite materials are either synthetically-produced (artificial graphite) or mined from the ground (natural graphite), then heavily processed before being baked onto a copper foil to serve as anodes.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global Needle Coke for Anode Materials for Li-ion Battery market size was estimated at USD 1025 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 3203.96 million by 2032, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 13.50% during the forecast period.</p>
