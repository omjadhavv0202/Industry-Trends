<h1>Needle Free Extension Set Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Needle Free Extension Sets are an essential medical device that connects to an IV catheter to extend its capabilities, offering a safer and more comfortable alternative to traditional needle-based access. These extension sets allow for the administration of medication without the need for additional needle insertions, significantly reducing the risk of needlestick injuries to healthcare workers and enhancing patient safety. They are primarily used in hospitals, clinics, and ambulatory surgical centers to manage intravenous therapies efficiently while minimizing pain and discomfort for patients. These devices come in single-lumen and double-lumen types, depending on the specific medical requirements.</p>
