<h1>Nelaton Catheter Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>The global Nelaton Catheter market refers to the segment of the medical device industry focused on the production and distribution of Nelaton catheters. These are simple, straight catheters used primarily for short-term bladder catheterization. Nelaton catheters are designed for easy insertion into the bladder for drainage purposes, and they are most often used in clinical settings such as hospitals and clinics. They are designed for single-use to avoid infections and ensure proper hygiene during catheterization.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>A Nelaton catheter typically consists of flexible, biocompatible materials such as latex or silicone, which make the insertion and removal process more comfortable for the patient. These catheters are available in various sizes, catering to different patients based on their anatomy and the clinical requirements.</p>
