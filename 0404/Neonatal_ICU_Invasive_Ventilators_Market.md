<h1>Neonatal ICU Invasive Ventilators Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The Neonatal ICU Invasive Ventilators market pertains to medical devices specifically designed to provide ventilator support to preterm and critically ill infants suffering from respiratory failure. These neonates typically have low-compliance lungs, small tidal volumes, high airway resistance, and elevated respiratory rates, necessitating specialized equipment. Neonatal ICU invasive ventilators are classified as invasive because they involve endotracheal intubation to deliver ventilatory support directly into the lungs, ensuring effective oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination. These devices are integral in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) to manage respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and other critical respiratory conditions in neonates.</p>
