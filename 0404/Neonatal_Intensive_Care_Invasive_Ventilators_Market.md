<h1>Neonatal Intensive Care Invasive Ventilators Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The Neonatal Intensive Care Invasive Ventilators (NICU Invasive Ventilators) market revolves around ventilators specifically designed to provide respiratory support to preterm and critically ill infants. These ventilators address conditions such as respiratory failure by accommodating the unique physiological needs of neonates, including low lung compliance, small tidal volumes, high airway resistance, and elevated respiratory rates. Invasive ventilators are critical in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) as they deliver ventilatory support through endotracheal intubation, ensuring precise oxygenation and ventilation for fragile patients.</p>
