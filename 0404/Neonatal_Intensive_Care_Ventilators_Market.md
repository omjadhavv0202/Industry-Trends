<h1>Neonatal Intensive Care Ventilators Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Neonatal Intensive Care ventilators provide vital respiratory support to preterm and critically ill infants who experience respiratory failure. These infants typically present with low lung compliance, small tidal volumes, high airway resistance, and elevated respiratory rates, making independent breathing insufficient. These specialized mechanical ventilators facilitate alveolar gas exchange, ensuring proper oxygenation and carbon dioxide (CO2) elimination by generating positive pressure to inflate the infant???s lungs. As a cornerstone of neonatal intensive care, these devices are essential for promoting survival and recovery in vulnerable neonates.</p>
