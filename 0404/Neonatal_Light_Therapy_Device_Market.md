<h1>Neonatal Light Therapy Device Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Neonatal Light Therapy Devices</strong> are specialized medical devices used to treat neonatal jaundice, a common condition in newborns caused by elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood. These devices expose newborns to specific wavelengths of light to break down excess bilirubin, which is then eliminated from the body. The devices typically use polychromatic polarized light, lasers, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), fluorescent lamps, dichroic lamps, or full-spectrum light to achieve therapeutic effects. The two primary types of neonatal light therapy devices are phototherapy lamps and phototherapy blankets.</p>
