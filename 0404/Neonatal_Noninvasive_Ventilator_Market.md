<h1>Neonatal Noninvasive Ventilator Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Neonatal ventilators are specialized medical devices designed to provide ventilatory support to preterm and critically ill infants suffering from respiratory failure. These patients typically present with unique challenges, including low-compliance lungs, small tidal volumes, high airway resistance, and elevated respiratory rates. Among these, Neonatal Noninvasive Ventilators stand out for their ability to deliver respiratory support without the need for invasive procedures, making them an essential tool in neonatal care.</p>
