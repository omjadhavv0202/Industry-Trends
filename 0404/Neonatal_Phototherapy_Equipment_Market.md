<h1>Neonatal Phototherapy Equipment Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Neonatal phototherapy devices are specialized medical equipment designed to treat neonatal jaundice, a common condition affecting newborns characterized by elevated bilirubin levels. If left untreated, neonatal jaundice can progress to severe hyperbilirubinemia, potentially leading to neurological damage or death. These devices utilize light therapy to break down excess bilirubin in the blood, facilitating its excretion and preventing complications. The equipment is categorized by type and application, making it adaptable for various clinical and home settings.</p>
