<h1>Separation Membrane Needleless Infusion Connector Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Needleless infusion connectors are one of the important components of needleless infusion systems. These connectors eliminate the need for steel needles to pierce rubber stoppers and connect infusion sets or syringes to indwelling cannulas, including CVCs, PICCs, and peripheral intravenous catheters. The needle-based injection is changed to a needle-free injection system, and the sealing function of the infusion channel can still be maintained after the infusion set or syringe is disconnected. Needleless infusion connectors can avoid the use of needles for repeated punctures and reduce stabbing injuries to medical staff.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global Separation Membrane Needleless Infusion Connector market size was estimated at USD 132 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 215.55 million by 2032, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.60% during the forecast period.</p>
