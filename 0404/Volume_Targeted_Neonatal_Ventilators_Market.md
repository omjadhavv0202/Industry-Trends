<h1>Volume Targeted Neonatal Ventilators Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Volume Targeted Neonatal Ventilators (VTNVs) are specialized medical devices designed to provide respiratory support to preterm and critically ill infants suffering from respiratory failure. These infants often have unique challenges, including low lung compliance, small tidal volumes, high airway resistance, and elevated respiratory rates. VTNVs use volume-targeted ventilation (VTV) technology to deliver precise and stable tidal volumes, which reduces the risk of lung injury and ensures consistent stabilization of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) levels. This approach has revolutionized neonatal care by enhancing patient outcomes and minimizing ventilator-induced lung injuries.</p>
