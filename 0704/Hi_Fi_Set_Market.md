 <p>High fidelity (often shortened to Hi-Fi) is the high-quality reproduction of sound. It is important to audiophiles and home audio enthusiasts. Ideally, high-fidelity equipment has inaudible noise and distortion, and a flat (neutral, uncolored) frequency response within the human hearing range. Hi-Fi headphones aim to offer people the best possible sound quality experience, providing value for money without compromise. Simply put, HiFi headphones are those headphones that offer high fidelity. This means that a pair of hifi music headphones will allow people to listen to a track the way it was recorded originally.</p>
