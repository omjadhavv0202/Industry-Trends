 <p>High-flow therapy (HFT) systems, also known as high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy or high-flow oxygen therapy, are medical devices used to deliver heated and humidified oxygen-enriched air to patients with respiratory insufficiency or failure. HFT systems provide a higher flow rate of oxygen compared to traditional oxygen therapy methods, such as nasal cannula or face masks, and are designed to deliver oxygen at flow rates exceeding the patient&#39;s peak inspiratory flow rate.</p>
