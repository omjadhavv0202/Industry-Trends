<h1>High Oleic Peanut Oil Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">High oleic peanut oil is a premium-grade edible oil derived from specially bred peanuts containing more than 75% oleic acid. Oleic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid, is known to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) while boosting high-density lipoprotein (HDL), thereby improving heart health. This oil offers superior oxidative stability, making it ideal for high-temperature cooking, frying, and extended shelf-life applications. Compared to conventional peanut oils, high oleic peanut oil has a healthier lipid profile, positioning it as a preferred choice in the food processing industry and household cooking.</p>
