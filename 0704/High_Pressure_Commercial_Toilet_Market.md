 <p>High Pressure Commercial Toilet also means pressure-flushing toilets. Pressure-flushing toilets are especially common in cities in the U.S. The ceramic tank is not used as a water tank. It holds a plastic pressure vessel of maybe one-third to one-half the ceramic tank&#39;s volume. That pressure tank contains a sealed air bladder. When the tank is filled from the water supply line, the tank fills with water until the air bladder compresses to the point that the tank pressure nearly equals the water supply line pressure.</p>
