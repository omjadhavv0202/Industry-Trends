 <p>High Voltage Jet Electrode Boiler refers to the furnace water is directly sprayed onto the electrode for heating instead of being directly immersed in the furnace water, that utilizes water as a resistor to conduct electrical current and create heat to generate steam. The spray type maintains its heating power by the amount of water sprayed, so the amount of water sprayed is very large, and the amount of water with high power can even reach more than 1000m3/h.</p>
