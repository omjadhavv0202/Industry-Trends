 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>HPP is a non-thermal, post-package pasteurization process used on foods in the refrigerated supply chain. It requires foods that have some level of water activity, mostly air-free, and packaging that can accommodate at least 15% compression (i.e. plastics). Foods must remain in cold supply chain (4??C) during processing and distribution.</p>
