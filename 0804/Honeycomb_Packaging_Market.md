 <p>Honeycomb structures are naturally occurring or man-made that have the geometry of a honeycomb. These are used between two thin sheets to make materials for honeycomb packaging. Honeycomb structure aids the material used in packaging in reducing density and increasing shear and compression properties. This enables in minimizing the material usage and maximizes strength. Honeycomb packaging is 100% ecofriendly, lightweight, shock absorbent and does not change in dimensions with temperature variations.</p>
