<h1>1-Hydroxybenzotriazole Monohydrate Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">1-Hydroxybenzotriazole Monohydrate (HOBt) is an organic compound derived from benzotriazole. It is commonly used as a coupling reagent in peptide synthesis. HOBt exists as a white crystalline powder and typically contains approximately 11.7% water by weight in its monohydrate form. This compound plays a critical role in pharmaceutical manufacturing, as well as in biochemical research. The anhydrous form of HOBt is known to be explosive, making the monohydrate form a safer alternative for industrial use.</p>
