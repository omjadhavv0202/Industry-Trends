<h1>E1442 Food Additive Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">E1442, scientifically known as Hydroxypropyl Distarch Phosphate (HDP), is a modified starch used extensively in the food industry as a thickening, stabilizing, and emulsifying agent. This food additive is derived from natural starch sources such as corn, potato, and tapioca and undergoes a chemical modification process involving propylene oxide and phosphoric acid. The modification enhances its ability to withstand heat, acid, and mechanical stress, making it particularly effective in processed foods. Common applications include dairy products, sauces, soups, gravies, and bakery fillings.</p>
