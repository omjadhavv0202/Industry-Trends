 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>Hyper-Spectral Imaging (HSI) Equipment combine the power of digital imaging and spectroscopy to provide more detailed scene information than regular color cameras. A normal color camera only acquires three different spectral channels corresponding to the red, green, and blue visual primary colors. Hyperspectral cameras can capture the light intensity (radiation) of a large number (usually tens to hundreds) of continuous spectral bands. Thus, each pixel in the image contains a continuous spectrum (radiation or reflection) and can be used to characterize objects in the scene with high precision and detail. Hyperspectral imaging results in greatly improved ability to classify objects in the scene based on its spectral properties.</p>
