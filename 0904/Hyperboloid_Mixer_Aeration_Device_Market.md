 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>Hyperboloid Mixer Aeration Device provides effective oxygen transfer and optimal mixing in the biological stage. In addition to the function of introducing oxygen, it can also complete the important functions of mixing and avoiding precipitation. Due to the mechanical aeration method, the oxygen transfer performance in wastewater is almost as high as that in pure water. Even after many years, the aeration performance will not decrease. The pressure loss of the system is always kept at a low level. It can be installed simply and quickly, focusing on severe municipal and industrial water treatment.</p>
