<h1>Industrial Grade Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC), also known as hypromellose, is a non-ionic cellulose mixed ether that is widely used in industrial applications. It is a semi-synthetic, inert, and viscoelastic polymer, primarily appearing as a white to off-white fibrous powder or granules. HPMC is soluble in water and some organic solvent systems but is insoluble in ethanol. The primary application of industrial-grade HPMC is in the construction industry, where it enhances the performance of cement-based materials. Other applications include synthetic resin production, petrochemicals, ceramics, paper manufacturing, leather processing, pharmaceuticals, food, and cosmetics.</p>
