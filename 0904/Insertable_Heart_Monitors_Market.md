 <p>Implantable cardiac monitors (ICM) are small electrophysiology (EP) devices that used for long-term monitoring of a patient&#39;s heart electrical activity to detect arrhythmias. The technology can eliminate the need for a bulkly external Holter monitor that requires wire leads attached to the patient. ICMs can be inserted under the skin during and office visit and record cardiac data continuously for up to 4.5 years.</p>
