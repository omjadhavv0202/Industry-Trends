 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>ISR stands for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance. In its macroscopic sense, ISR is a practice that links several battlefield functions together to assist a combat force in employing its sensors and managing the information they gather. Information is collected on the battlefield through systematic observation by deployed soldiers and a variety of electronic sensors. Surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance are methods of obtaining this information. The information is then passed to intelligence personnel for analysis, and then to the commander and their staff for the formulation of battle plans. Intelligence is processed information that is relevant and contributes to an understanding of the ground, and of enemy dispositions and intents. Intelligence failures can happen.Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) experts gather information regarding the enemy by observing their behavior and tracking movements. Staying three steps ahead of the enemy ensures mission success.</p>
