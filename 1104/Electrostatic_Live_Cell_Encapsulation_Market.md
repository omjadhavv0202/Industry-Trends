 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>Live cell encapsulation has long been proposed as a solution to many therapeutic problems in modern medicine. Cell encapsulation technology is used to immobilise cells within biocompatible and semipermeable membranes. Encapsulation of cells, rather than therapeutic products, is used to allow the delivery of molecules of interest for a longer time period because cells release these molecules of interest continuously. Furthermore, cells can be engineered to express the desired protein in vivo without modifying the host&#39;s genome. Cell encapsulation has a significant advantage over protein encapsulation because it allows for the sustained and controlled delivery of therapeutic molecules at a constant rate, resulting in higher physiological concentrations.</p>
