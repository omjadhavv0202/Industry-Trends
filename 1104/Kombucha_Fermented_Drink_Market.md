 <p>Kombucha Fermented Drink is a naturally effervescent beverage made by fermenting sweetened tea with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY). This ancient elixir, believed to have originated in Northeast China, is renowned for its probiotic content and is often promoted for its purported health benefits, such as improving digestion, detoxification, immune support, and even metabolic function. Kombucha is typically available in a range of flavors, with various fruits, herbs, and spices added during a secondary fermentation phase.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>Health-conscious consumers, wellness influencers, and alternative medicine practitioners have popularized kombucha as a natural alternative to sugary sodas and synthetic beverages. Its growing presence in mainstream retail channels and specialty health stores reflects increasing acceptance of functional drinks globally. The beverage&#39;s rise is also driven by shifting dietary preferences toward clean labels, plant-based options, and gut-health-supporting formulations.</p>
