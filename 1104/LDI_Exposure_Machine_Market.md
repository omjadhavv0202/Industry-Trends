 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>LDI (Laser Direct Imaging) exposure machine, also known as a Laser Direct Imaging system, is a specialized equipment used in the production of printed circuit boards (PCBs). It is an advanced technology that replaces traditional photolithography methods for imaging the PCB&#39;s circuit pattern onto a photosensitive material (resist) coated on the substrate. LDI systems use lasers to directly expose the PCB&#39;s resist with high precision, eliminating the need for photomasks or stencils. This technology offers several advantages over conventional photolithography, including increased accuracy, finer feature sizes, faster processing times, and improved efficiency.</p>
