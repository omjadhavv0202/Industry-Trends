 <p>Lead chemicals are a general term for various compounds of lead. All of the major soluble lead compounds have industrial uses. Lead acetate is used as a water repellent, for mildew protection, and as a mordant for cotton dyes. Lead acetate trihydrate is used in varnishes, chrome pigments, and as an analytical reagent, and lead chloride is used in asbestos clutch or brake linings, as a catalyst, and as a flame retardant. Lead nitrate is used in the manufacture of matches and explosives, as a heat stabilizer in nylon, and as a coating on paper for photothermography. Lead subacetate is used in sugar analysis and for clarifying solutions of organic substances (HSDB 2009). The insoluble lead compounds also have a variety of uses. Lead azide and lead styphnate both are used in munitions manufacture. Lead carbonate, lead fluoride, lead fluoborate, and lead naphthenate are used as catalysts, with additional uses in the electronic and optical industries (lead fluoride), in coatings for thermographic copying (lead carbonate), as a curing agent for epoxy resins (lead fluoborate), and as a varnish drier (lead naphthenate). Lead phosphate and lead stearate both are used as stabilizers in the plastics industry. Lead iodide and lead sulfate are used in photography; lead iodide is also used in thermoelectric materials, and lead sulfate with zinc in galvanic batteries. Lead chromate is used as a pigment in paints, rubber, and plastics; lead tetraoxide is used in plasters, ointments, glazes, and varnishes.</p>
