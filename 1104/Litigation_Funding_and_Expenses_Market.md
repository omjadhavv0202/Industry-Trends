 <p>Litigation funding, also known as litigation finance, can mean many things. In general, it describes the provision of capital by a third-party ??litigation funder?? to a plaintiff in a litigation. In return, the litigation funder receives a portion of what the plaintiff recovers. The capital provided by monetizing a legal claim may directly pay for some of the costs of litigation, including attorneys?? fees, expert witness fees and court expenses. Litigation finance may be used to fund working capital for companies involved in litigation or even help business owners pay for personal expenses. A third party professional funder can pay some or all of the costs/expenses associated with a dispute in return for a share of the proceeds of the dispute if it is successful. If the litigation is not successful, the funder bears the costs it has agreed to fund.</p>
