 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>Maskless direct writing lithography refers to the technology of using optical replication to print patterns onto photosensitive recording materials, and then transferring the patterns onto wafers through etching to create electronic circuits. The lithography system is called a lithography machine, the quartz plate with patterns is called a mask, and the photosensitive recording material is called a photoresist or resist.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>The maskless direct writing lithography equipment technology is a new technology derived from traditional optical lithography technology, because its exposure imaging method is basically similar to traditional projection lithography, with the difference being the use of digital DMD instead of traditional masks. Its main principle is to input the required lithography patterns into the DMD chip through software through a computer, and change the rotation angle of the DMD chip micro mirror based on the distribution of black and white pixels in the image, And by shining a collimated light source onto the DMD chip, a light image consistent with the required pattern is projected onto the substrate surface, and large-scale microstructure preparation is achieved by controlling the movement of the sample stage.</p>
