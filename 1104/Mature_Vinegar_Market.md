<h1>Mature Vinegar Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Mature Vinegar is a type of aged vinegar known for its deep, malty, woody, and smoky flavor. Originating from East Asia, particularly southern China, it gained prominence in the city of Zhenjiang, where it became famously known as Chinkiang vinegar. This variety is primarily crafted from glutinous rice, sorghum, or a combination of grains such as wheat and millet. The aging process enhances its umami-rich profile, making it a staple ingredient in Asian cuisine, particularly in marinades, dipping sauces, and stir-fry dishes.</p>
