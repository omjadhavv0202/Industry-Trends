<h1>Minimally Invasive Laser Lipolysis Machine Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Lipo Laser is a very minimally invasive procedure that uses a laser to remove excess fat under the skin by causing cells to release their contents. In a minimally-invasive laser lipolysis treatment (often called laser liposuction), a practitioner will inject local anaesthetic and create an incision in your skin. They will then insert a laser probe which will be directed to the fat to heat it, before then the fat will be sucked out or left inside the body to be absorbed. The treatment will take 1-2 hours. Results are usually seen within 4-12 weeks and more than one treatment is usually needed.</p>
