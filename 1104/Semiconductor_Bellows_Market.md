 </p><p>Report Overview</p><p>
 
 Metal bellows are elastic vessels that can be compressed when pressure is applied to the vessel, or extended under vacuum. when the pressure or vacuum is released, the bellows will return to its original shape. Especially welded bellows are manufactured by welding a number of individually formed diaphragms to each other. Welded metal bellows provide high reliability and long life for applications such as wafer lift and chamber lift, vacuum feedthroughs, and vacuum valve seals. Bellows are widely used in semiconductor equipment like CVD, PVD, ETCH, Ion Implanter, CMP, and Wafer Transfer Robots.</p><p>
