 <p>In urinary catheterization a latex, polyurethane, or silicone tube known as a urinary catheter is inserted into a patient&#39;s bladder via the urethra. Catheterization allows the patient&#39;s urine to drain freely from the bladder for collection. It may be used to inject liquids used for treatment or diagnosis of bladder conditions. A clinician, often a nurse, usually performs the procedure, but self-catheterization is also possible. The catheter may be a permanent one (indwelling catheter), or an intermittent catheter removed after each catheterization. A urinary catheter is a tube placed in the body to drain and collect urine from the bladder.</p>
