<h1>Flux for Semiconductor Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>In the soldering process of electronic products, rosin resin flux mainly composed of rosin, resin, halide-containing activator, additive and organic solvent is generally used. Chemical substances that can help and promote the welding process in the welding process, while having a protective effect and preventing oxidation reactions. Mainly include "auxiliary heat conduction", "remove oxides", "reduce the surface tension of welded materials", "remove oil stains on the surface of welded materials, increase welding area", and "prevent re-oxidation". There are two key functions in this respect: "removal of oxides" and "reducing the surface tension of the material being welded".</p>
