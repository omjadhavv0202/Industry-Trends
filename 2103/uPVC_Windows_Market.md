<h1>uPVC Windows Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">uPVC (unplasticized polyvinyl chloride) windows are made from a durable, rigid plastic material that does not include plasticizers, making them highly strong and resistant to environmental conditions. uPVC windows are manufactured by heating the uPVC powder, injecting it into a mold to shape the frame, and applying cooling techniques to solidify the structure. These windows are known for their energy efficiency, weather resistance, and long lifespan, making them a popular choice in residential, commercial, and industrial settings.</p>
