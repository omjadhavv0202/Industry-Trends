 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>In computer networking, a wireless access point (WAP), or more generally just access point (AP), is a networking hardware device that allows other Wi-Fi devices to connect to a wired network. As a standalone device, the AP may have a wired connection to a router, but, in a wireless router, it can also be an integral component of the router itself. An AP is differentiated from a hotspot which is a physical location where Wi-Fi access is available. Wireless access points work to extend the range of your network within a building, office, or home. In-ceiling wireless access points work like any other access device. However, they are meant to be mounted within or attached to the ceiling of a workspace. Mounting to the ceiling means that these wireless access points take very little space and are viable in almost any location.</p>
