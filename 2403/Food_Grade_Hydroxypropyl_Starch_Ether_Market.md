 <p data-end="601" data-start="96"><span style="font-size:16px;">Industrial Grade Hydroxypropyl Starch Ether (HPSE) is a white or colorless powder with excellent fluidity and water solubility, making it ideal for use in various industries. Upon dissolving in water, HPSE forms a transparent, colorless, and stable solution. Its primary applications stem from its unique properties, including good viscosity, film-forming ability, and thickening capabilities, making it highly valuable in sectors such as construction, personal care, pharmaceuticals, and food processing.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p data-end="1107" data-start="603"><span style="font-size:16px;">HPSE is derived from starch, typically from corn or potatoes, through a process of etherification, which involves the introduction of hydroxypropyl groups into the starch structure. This chemical modification enhances its solubility and stability, allowing HPSE to function effectively in both aqueous and non-aqueous systems. In the industrial sector, it is commonly used as a binder, thickener, stabilizer, and emulsifier, contributing to the improvement of product performance in various applications.</span></p>
