 <p data-end="783" data-start="95"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong data-end="120" data-start="95">Hybrid energy systems</strong> that integrate both solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind generators are commonly known as <strong data-end="243" data-start="214">wind-solar hybrid systems</strong>. These systems harness the power of both renewable energy sources to provide electricity. The primary advantage of combining wind and solar energy is that it allows for a more consistent and reliable power generation model. Solar and wind energy complement each other due to their intermittent nature ??? while the sun may not always shine, the wind may blow, and vice versa. This synergy helps reduce dependency on conventional power sources, making wind-solar hybrid systems an increasingly popular solution in both remote and urban areas.</span></p>
