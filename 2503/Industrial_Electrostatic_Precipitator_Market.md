 <p>Industrial electrostatic precipitator is a device used to remove particulate matter and other pollutants from industrial flue gas emissions. The process involves charging the particles in the gas stream with an electrical field, causing them to be attracted to oppositely charged plates or tubes, where they accumulate and are periodically removed. Industrial electrostatic precipitators are commonly used in a variety of industries, including power generation, cement production, steel mills, and chemical processing, among others. They are effective at removing a wide range of particulate matter, including dust, ash, and soot, as well as acid mists and other pollutants.</p>
