 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>Injectable implants are injections of material into the urethra to help control urine leakage (urinary incontinence) caused by a weak urinary sphincter. Injectable therapy using bulking agents composed of synthetic materials, bovine collagen, or autologous substances augment the urethral wall and increase urethral resistance to urinary flow. The injection of bulking agents to treat a dysfunctional urethra is a minimally invasive method of correcting intrinsic sphincteric deficiency that results in stress urinary incontinence but is being performed less frequently in current practice.</p>
