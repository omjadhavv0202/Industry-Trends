 <p data-end="549" data-start="16">Inkjet card printers are specialized devices designed to print high-quality images, text, and graphics directly onto plastic cards. These printers utilize inkjet technology, where tiny droplets of ink are precisely deposited onto the card surface to create detailed and vibrant prints. Common applications include the production of identification cards, access control cards, membership cards, and loyalty cards, serving sectors such as corporate enterprises, educational institutions, government agencies, and commercial businesses.</p>
