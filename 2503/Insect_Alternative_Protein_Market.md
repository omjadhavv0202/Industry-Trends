<h1>Insect Alternative Protein Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Insect alternative protein refers to the proteins derived from insects used as food ingredients to replace traditional protein sources such as meat, soy, and dairy. This emerging sector is gaining traction as consumers and industries seek sustainable, eco-friendly, and high-nutrition alternatives to conventional proteins. Insects like mealworms, grasshoppers, black soldier flies, and locusts are rich in protein, vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats, making them an excellent option for human and animal consumption.</p>
