<h1>Jersey Milk Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Jersey milk is a type of dairy milk sourced from Jersey cows, a breed known for its high-quality milk with rich taste and superior nutritional content. Originating from the Channel Islands, Jersey cows are smaller and leaner compared to Holstein cows. Their milk is prized for its higher butterfat and protein content, making it a preferred choice for dairy products such as cheese, butter, and yogurt. The unique composition of Jersey milk enhances its flavor, texture, and nutritional benefits, setting it apart from regular milk varieties.</p>
