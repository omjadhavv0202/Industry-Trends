<h1>Kefir Products Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Kefir is a traditional fermented milk drink originating from the Caucasus Mountains. It is produced by inoculating milk???typically from cows, goats, or sheep???with kefir "grains," a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast. This fermentation process results in a probiotic-rich, slightly carbonated beverage with a tangy taste. Traditional kefir was made in goatskin bags that were continuously agitated by household activity, ensuring even fermentation. Today, kefir is widely recognized for its health benefits, including improved digestion, gut health, and immune system support, making it a staple in functional and probiotic food markets.</p>
