<h1>Kosher Food Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Kosher food refers to food items that comply with Jewish dietary laws, known as kashrut. These laws specify which foods are permissible (kosher) and how they must be prepared. The kosher certification process involves stringent supervision by authorized religious organizations to ensure compliance with dietary rules. Kosher foods are categorized into three main groups: Meat (from permitted animals slaughtered according to Jewish law), Dairy (produced from kosher animals without mixing with meat), and Pareve (neutral foods that are neither meat nor dairy, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and fish).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>While originally rooted in religious traditions, kosher food has gained popularity among health-conscious consumers, individuals with dietary restrictions, and those seeking high-quality food products.</p>
