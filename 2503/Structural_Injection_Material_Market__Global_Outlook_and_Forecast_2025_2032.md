 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>Injection local anesthetics are medications used to temporarily block sensation in a specific area of the body during medical or dental procedures. By inhibiting nerve signal transmission at the injection site, these drugs provide pain relief and allow for various procedures to be performed with minimal discomfort to the patient. Commonly used local anesthetics include lidocaine, bupivacaine, and mepivacaine. They are administered through injections directly into the tissue near the nerves that need to be numbed.</p>
