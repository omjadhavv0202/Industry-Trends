 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>Oil condensing boilers are water heaters fueled by oil. They achieve high efficiency (typically greater than 90% on the higher heating value) by condensing water vapour in the exhaust gases and so recovering its latent heat of vaporisation, which would otherwise have been wasted. This condensed vapour leaves the system in liquid form, via a drain. In many countries, the use of condensing boilers is compulsory or encouraged with financial incentives.</p>
