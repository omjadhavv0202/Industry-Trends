<h1>Noise Radar Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Noise radar is a form of random signal radar that uses a noise waveform as the transmitted signal and applies coherent processing of radar returns. Unlike conventional radar systems that rely on pulse, continuous wave (CW), frequency-modulated (FM), or FM/CW signals, noise radar leverages the random nature of its signal to enhance stealth and resilience against electronic countermeasures (ECM). These characteristics make it particularly valuable in applications such as surveillance and feedback systems.</p>
