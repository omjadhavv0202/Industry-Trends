<h1>NOR Flash for ADAS Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>NOR Flash for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) refers to a type of non-volatile storage technology characterized by its ability to retain data without requiring power. It is distinguished by fast random access times, enabling the efficient reading of small data segments from any memory address. These attributes make NOR Flash a critical component in ADAS applications, which rely on real-time data processing for functionalities like navigation, lane departure warnings, driving records, and image processing.</p>
