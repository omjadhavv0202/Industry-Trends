<h1>Noise Detection Sound Level Meter Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Noise detection refers to the use of a sound level meter (also known as a sound pressure level meter) to measure the intensity of sound in an environment and its frequency distribution. Sound level meters can express the intensity of sound in decibels (dB), which helps to assess the noise level in an environment, such as industrial equipment, transportation, or urban life. They are designed to take into account the human ear&#39;s perception of different frequencies in order to accurately reflect the potential impact of noise on humans.</p>
