<h1>Office Building Distributed Antenna Systems Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2030</h1><br/><p>The <strong>Office Building Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS)</strong> is a telecommunications infrastructure solution designed to improve wireless coverage and capacity within large buildings, such as office complexes, commercial spaces, or other multi-story structures. DAS is a network of antennas distributed throughout a building that connect to a central hub, providing enhanced wireless services like cellular connectivity, Wi-Fi, and public safety communication systems.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>By utilizing these distributed systems, buildings can overcome dead zones, reduce signal interference, and support high data capacity for multiple users, ensuring that communications are not disrupted. These systems can be implemented using active, passive, or hybrid components depending on the design and needs of the building.</p>
