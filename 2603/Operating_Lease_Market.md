<h1>Operating Lease Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Operating Lease is a financial arrangement in which one party (the lessee) rents an asset, such as equipment or machinery, from another party (the lessor) for a specified period. Unlike a capital lease, an operating lease is typically short-term and does not transfer ownership of the asset to the lessee. It is often used for assets that have a shorter useful life and allows businesses to use the asset without the long-term commitment of ownership.</p>
