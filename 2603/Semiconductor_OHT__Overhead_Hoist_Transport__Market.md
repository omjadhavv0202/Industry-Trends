<h1>Semiconductor OHT (Overhead Hoist Transport) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2030</h1><br/><p><strong>Semiconductor OHT (Overhead Hoist Transport)</strong> refers to an automated material handling system designed specifically for semiconductor manufacturing facilities. The system operates on aerial tracks, enabling efficient, fast, and stable transportation of semiconductor wafers within cleanroom environments. Utilizing motor-driven hoist mechanisms, OHT systems transfer FOUPs (Front Open Unified Pods) to various processing zones without occupying valuable floor space. Their adoption is essential in modern wafer fabrication plants, especially for 200mm and 300mm wafer fabs, where precision, speed, and contamination-free handling are critical to maintaining product quality and throughput.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>OHT systems are highly versatile, offering configurations like single-track and double-track systems, with each tailored to the specific needs of semiconductor production facilities.</p>
