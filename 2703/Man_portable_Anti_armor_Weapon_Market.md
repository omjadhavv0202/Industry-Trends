<h1>Man-portable Anti-armor Weapon Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Man-portable anti-tank systems (MANPATS or MPATS) are lightweight, shoulder-launched anti-tank rockets used primarily by infantry forces. These weapons are typically unguided and pose significant threats to armored vehicles, low-flying aircraft (particularly helicopters), and fortified positions. The ease of transport, operational flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of these weapons make them a critical component of modern military strategies.</p>
