<h1>Resistive Load Bank Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Load banks are devices designed to provide electrical loads for testing power sources such as generators and Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS). Load banks are also used to reduce "wet stacking" problems in diesel engines of backup generating systems. They are used in a variety of ways including factory testing of generator sets, periodic exercising of standby engine generator sets, battery system testing, ground power testing, load optimization in prime power applications, and factory testing of turbines. The load bank include resistive load bank, inductive load bank, capacitive load bank and manufacturers can provide the resistive/inductive load bank or resistive/inductive/capacitive load bank according to the Client&#39;s request.A Resistive load bank, the most common type, proves equivalent loading of both generator and prime mover. That is, for each kilowatt (or horsepower) of load applied to the generator by the load bank, an equal amount of load is applied to the prime mover by the generator.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global Resistive Load Bank market size was estimated at USD 39 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 53.62 million by 2032, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 3.60% during the forecast period.</p>
