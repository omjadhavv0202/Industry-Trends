 <p>An <strong>Atomic Layer Etching (ALE) system</strong> is a precise surface modification technology used in semiconductor manufacturing and materials science. It enables the controlled removal of atomic layers from a material&#39;s surface by using sequential, self-limiting chemical reactions. ALE is similar to atomic layer deposition (ALD) but in reverse, where etching processes occur layer by layer, allowing for highly uniform and precise patterning at the nanoscale. This technique is particularly valuable in the fabrication of advanced semiconductor devices, where it helps in achieving high-resolution etching with minimal damage to underlying layers, contributing to better device performance and yield.</p>
