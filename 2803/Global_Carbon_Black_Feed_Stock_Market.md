 <p>Carbon Black Feedstock (CBFS) refers to the raw materials or oils used in the production of carbon black, a fine black powder made from incomplete combustion or thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons. CBFS typically includes heavy oils, coal tar, or residual oils from refining processes. These feedstocks are processed in specialized reactors, where they undergo pyrolysis (decomposition at high temperatures) to produce carbon black. The quality and properties of the carbon black, such as particle size and surface area, depend on the type of feedstock and the production method used. Carbon black is widely used as a reinforcing agent in rubber products, especially tires, as well as in inks, coatings, and plastics.</p>
