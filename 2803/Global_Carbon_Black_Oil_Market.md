 <p>Carbon Black Oil (CBO) is a byproduct of the carbon black production process, specifically generated during the pyrolysis of hydrocarbon feedstocks like heavy oils, coal tar, or residual oils. CBO is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, including aromatic compounds, and typically has a high carbon content. It can be used as a fuel or as a feedstock for further refining processes. Additionally, CBO is sometimes employed in the production of other chemicals or as a raw material in industries such as energy generation or petrochemicals. Its characteristics and potential uses vary based on the specific feedstock and production process used to generate it.</p>
