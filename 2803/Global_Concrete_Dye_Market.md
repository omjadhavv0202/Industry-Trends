 <p><strong>Concrete Dye</strong> is a liquid or powder pigment used to color concrete surfaces. Unlike concrete stains, which chemically react with the surface, dyes are typically absorbed into the concrete and provide a more intense and vibrant color. Concrete dyes are often used for decorative purposes in both indoor and outdoor applications, such as floors, countertops, and walls. They come in a variety of colors and are usually applied using a sprayer, brush, or roller. Dyes are often used in conjunction with sealers to enhance and protect the color while providing a glossy or matte finish.</p>
