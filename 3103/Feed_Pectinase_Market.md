<h1>Global Pectinase Enzyme Market Research Report 2025, Forecast to 2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Pectinase, also called polygalacturonase, is a naturally occurring enzyme that breaks down pectin, which is a substance found in the cell walls of certain types of plants and fruits. Pectin helps ripening fruits hold their shape; as a fruit becomes overripe, the pectin breaks down into simple sugars and the fruit consequently gets soft.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global Pectinase Enzyme market size was estimated at USD 365 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 510.59 million by 2032, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 3.80% during the forecast period.</p>
