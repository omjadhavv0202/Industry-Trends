 <p>PFA tubing is such a rigid material, that in some cases can even replace stainless steel tubing. Its benefits come at a higher price, of course, but many professionals will prefer it. PFA tubing handles high temperatures and pressures well. PFA tubing is also resistant to chemicals, even when they sit in the system for prolonged periods of time. The lack of inertness in some chemicals can be destructive to most tubings. PFA tubing is a go-to option for moving elements. Its flexibility and resistance to cracks and breaks make it perfect for moving parts in machinery. PFA Tubing provides stiffness and long flex-life while working in temperatures up to 260</p>
