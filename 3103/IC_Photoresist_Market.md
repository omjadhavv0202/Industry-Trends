<h1>Global IC Photoresist Market Research Report 2025, Forecast to 2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Photoresist is a chemical essential for semiconductor manufacturing. The photoresists known as a photosensitive material, initiate a chemical reaction in the light. It is a chemical that plays an essential role in photolithography, a technology that is involved in the manufacture of semiconductor devices. In the semiconductor manufacturing, the exposure process that a photoengraving technique is applied to reduce and transfer the design drawn on the original plate (photomask) onto the silicon chip. To create power-saving, high-performance semiconductors, the circuits that are to be transferred need to be rendered smaller.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global IC Photoresist market size was estimated at USD 2436 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 4478.49 million by 2032, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 7.00% during the forecast period.</p>
