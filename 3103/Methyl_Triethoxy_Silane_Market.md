 <p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Methyltriethoxysilane is an alkylalkoxysilane. It is a clear, colorless liquid with an odor characteristic of alcohols. It hydrolyzes slowly in the presence of moisture to form reactive silanols. These react further to produce oligosiloxanes and then polysiloxanes. As a Filler Modifier, Methyltrimethoxysilane is used mainly to render a wide range of surfaces and materials water repellent (e.g. mineral fillers, pigments, glass, cardboard). It may be used pure or in solution to treat fillers, using suitable mixing equipment. It may be necessary to first pre-treat the substrate with water and/or a catalyst. It is also used in the production of silicone resins and condensation-curing silicone rubber, used as an important component in sol-gel systems.</p>
