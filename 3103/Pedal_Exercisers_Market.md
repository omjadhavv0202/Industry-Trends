<h1>Global Pedelec Batteries Market Research Report 2025, Forecast to 2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Pedelec Battery: A Pedelec battery, also known as an e-bike battery or electric bicycle battery, is a rechargeable energy storage device used in pedal-assist electric bicycles (Pedelecs). These batteries are typically lithium-ion or lithium-polymer and are designed to provide electrical power to an electric motor, which assists the rider&#39;s pedaling efforts. The battery&#39;s capacity is measured in watt-hours (Wh) and determines the range a Pedelec can achieve on a single charge. It is usually mounted on or within the bicycle frame and can be removed for charging. The Pedelec&#39;s motor controller manages the interaction between the battery, the rider&#39;s pedaling, and the desired level of assistance, ensuring a seamless and efficient riding experience.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global Pedelec Batteries market size was estimated at USD 961.50 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 2037.11 million by 2032, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 8.70% during the forecast period.</p>
