<h1>Global Permanent Magnetic Materials Market Research Report 2025, Forecast to 2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Permanent magnets are materials that produce a magnetic field permanently. Unlike temporary magnets, they require no external current or other excitation to maintain their magnetism. Once magnetized, they will retain their magnetism for a period of time until they lose their magnetism due to external interference or the gradual decay of the magnetic field. Permanent Magnets major include the rare earth permanent magnets and ferrite magnets.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global Permanent Magnetic Materials market size was estimated at USD 13250 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 25616.89 million by 2032, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 7.60% during the forecast period.</p>
