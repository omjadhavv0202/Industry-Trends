 <p>Pharmaceutical grade activated carbon is a highly porous and adsorptive material that is commonly used in the purification of drugs and pharmaceuticals. It is produced from high-quality raw materials, such as coconut shells or wood, through a process of activation that involves heating them in the presence of a gas, such as steam or carbon dioxide. The resulting activated carbon has a large surface area and a high degree of microporosity, which makes it highly effective at adsorbing impurities from liquids and gases.</p>
