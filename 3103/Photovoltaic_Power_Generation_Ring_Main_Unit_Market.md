 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Photovoltaic power station is a facility that uses solar energy to generate electricity. It is usually composed of multiple photovoltaic modules. Through the conversion of solar cells, light energy is converted into electrical energy. The ring main unit is a device in the power grid, which is used to connect the electrical energy to the grid and transmit the electrical energy to each user end. In the photovoltaic power station, the ring main unit plays a vital role. It can connect the electrical energy generated by the photovoltaic power station to the grid, thereby realizing the transmission and utilization of electrical energy. The ring main unit is a group of electrical equipment (high-voltage switchgear) installed in a metal or non-metallic insulating cabinet or made into an assembled interval ring network power supply unit. Its core part uses load switches and fuses, which have the advantages of simple structure, small size, low price, and can improve power supply parameters and performance as well as power supply safety. It is widely used in distribution stations and box-type substations in urban residential areas, high-rise buildings, large public buildings, factories and enterprises, photovoltaic power generation and other load centers.</p>
