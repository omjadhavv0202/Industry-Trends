<h1>Global Desktop pH Meter Market Research Report 2025, Forecast to 2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>PH meter refers to the instrument used to measure the pH value of solution. The pH meter works on the principle of galvanic cell. The electromotive force between the two electrodes of galvanic cell is based on Nernst&#39;s law, which is related to both the properties of the electrode itself and the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. There is a corresponding relationship between the electromotive force of the primary battery and the hydrogen ion concentration. The negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration is the pH value. PH meter is a common analytical instrument, which is widely used in agriculture, environmental protection and industry. Soil pH value is one of the important basic properties of soil. Factors such as temperature and ionic strength of the solution to be measured shall be considered during pH measurement.</p>
